# 2. Linux Basic
Before getting into bash scripting, I'd like to start with some simple Linux basics.

## 2.1 What is LInux?

* Kernel

  The Linux kernel is the heart of the system, and controls how memory, programs and hardware interact.
  
  #### Key features of the kernel
  
    1. system memory management

    2. software program management

    3. hardware management

      Any device connected to a Linux system requires driver code embedded inside the kernel code.
      A Linux system identifies a hardware device by a device file.
      
        * Character   - one character at a time for process data
        * Block       - large amounts of data at once, such as disk drives
        * Network     - use packets to send and receive data

    4. file system management


* GNU Utilities

  #### GNU Coreutiles packages
  
    * to handle files
    * to manipulate text
    * to manage the process

  #### Shell
  The GNU/Linux shell is a special interactive utility. The command prompt is reponsible for interacting with thie shell.
  When you enter a text command through this, shell interprets it and execute it in the kernel.


* Graphical Desktop Environment


* Application Software
