Before getting into bash scripting, I'd like to start with some simple Linux basics.

## What is LInux?

  ### Kernel

    #### Key features of the kernel

      1. system memory management

      2. software program management

3. hardware management

  Any device connected to a Linux system requires driver code embedded inside the kernel code.
  
  A Linux system identifies a hardware device by a device file.
  
    * Character   - one character at a time for process data
    * Block       - large amounts of data at once, such as disk drives
    * Network     - use packets to send and receive data


4. file system management


### GNU Utilities

#### GNU Coreutiles packages

  * to handle files
  * to manipulate text
  * to manage the process

#### Shell
The GNU/Linux shell is a special interactive utility. The command prompt is reponsible for interacting with thie shell.
When you enter a text command through this, shell interprets it and execute it in the kernel.
